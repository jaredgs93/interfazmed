Pleasure to thank you. You two know each other? Yeah. Old pals. You know, Jamie, since he was eight? You taught me how to play tests. Big mistake. He beats me every time. I'm not kidding. Hey. Jamie, I've got your test results back. I wish they were a little more encouraging. Your pancetta peanut, which means that your cell counts are low. You've got a blood pH of 7.14, which means... I do. I do. I'd like to innovate you. Put you to sleep. Get you on a ventilator. You're getting fatigued. This would just allow you to rest so that the antibiotics can do their job. I've been to innovate eight times. I think I'll skip it. All right. I'll check back in later, huh? Dr. Charles? Jamie has pneumonia. If there's any hope of beating it, I need to get him out of ventilator now. You heard what he said, he didn't want that. No, it passed what Jamie wants. Yeah, what Dr. Wixley not passed what Jamie wants. The kid has been so brutalized his entire life. He has a right to say no. The only hope we have of keeping him alive. What's that going to give him? A week? Ten days? It could be six months, a year, more. And in that time, anything could happen. New treatments are coming along every day. Is he on the list? He right at the top. But it matches highly unlikely. He has HLA antibodies from an I-let-cell transplant. Have you spoken to his next kid? Have they waited on him? There isn't anybody. He had took up years ago. Mom's an alcoholic, but I didn't know. But Dr. Charles, you know what's going to happen. Jamie will lose consciousness. And as this doctor, I'm going to put him on a ventilator. But by then, it may be too late. There won't be any more choices. You know, I don't what anybody wants.
